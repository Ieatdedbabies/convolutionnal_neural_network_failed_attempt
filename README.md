# convolutionnal_neural_network_failed_attempt
Those are my feared and failed attempt at making convolutionnal neural network from scratch using only numpy as a library. 

The code is unedited (thus not practically readable) but I invested many months of my life trying to make this.

I am only adding comments to the code to make it friendlier to read.
